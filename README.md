# General solution for alphanumeric text-based captchas using Convolutional Neural Networks

## 50.038 Computational Data Science project
 The main objective of this project is to equip and familiarize students with the necessary skills to successfully complete a data science project, including data collection and processing, data exploration and visualization, identifying and formulating problems, developing algorithms and models, designing experimental evaluations and discussing results, scientific writing and working in teams.

## Repository structure
* `/data` data folder, included in `.gitignore`
* `/generate` code used to generate the Python `captcha` dataset
* `/captcha` a local version of the [captcha](https://github.com/lepture/captcha) library, modified so bounding boxes are extractable
* `/tex` source files for the report (compile using pdfLaTeX and BibTeX)
